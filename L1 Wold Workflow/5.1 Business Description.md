XXXXXINC, headquartered in Ontario, California, is strategically positioned to deliver high-quality bathroom products to the U.S. market. The Company’s mission is to provide cost-effective, reliable solutions for residential and commercial spaces, with a focus on products such as shower rooms, smart mirrors, and other bathroom accessories. XXXXXINC will bridge the gap between Chinese manufacturing and U.S. retail needs by utilizing warehousing, distribution, and after-sales support. This will enable the Company to provide localized services that will suit small-sized U.S. retailers, ensuring they have access to high-quality products at competitive prices without the complexities of international sourcing and logistics.

The Company will initially focus on expanding its presence through showrooms in key regions, starting with Los Angeles, California, in Year 1. These showrooms will serve as a platform for product demonstrations, allowing potential customers to experience the products firsthand. This strategy will help build brand recognition and provide local touchpoints for customers to interact with the Company’s offerings. The showrooms will not only serve as retail spaces but also as hubs for building relationships with U.S. distributors, enhancing XXXXXINC’s role in the U.S. market.

To support its growing business, XXXXXINC will utilize its strong supply chain infrastructure, which includes multiple third-party warehouses strategically located across the U.S. These facilities will handle the storage, distribution, and after-sales services necessary for the smooth operation of the Company’s business. By providing these services locally, XXXXXINC ensures that U.S. retailers and consumers receive fast, efficient, and reliable access to the products they need, backed by a strong commitment to customer satisfaction. The warehousing and distribution network will play a vital role in the Company’s ability to scale operations and meet the demands of its expanding customer base.

One of the key competitive advantages for XXXXXINC is its direct connection to [CN Company], its Chinese Parent Company. This relationship enables the Company to offer more cost-effective products, as it bypasses intermediaries, resulting in lower prices for U.S. retailers and consumers. Additionally, the Company benefits from the extensive experience of its Parent Company in manufacturing high-quality bathroom products, which translates into superior product reliability and performance. This expertise will also allow XXXXXINC to provide ongoing technical support and after-sales service, ensuring that a strong customer support infrastructure backs its products.

Through the establishment of the U.S. Subsidiary, the Company will streamline its operations, improve communication between the U.S. and Chinese teams, and quickly adapt to market demands. The Company’s ability to quickly respond to U.S. market needs and relay these insights to its Chinese operations for targeted product development ensures it will remain competitive in the dynamic U.S. market. This adaptability, combined with its localized services, positions XXXXXINC for long-term success in the Bathroom Products Industry.

To maintain a high standard of quality and efficiency, XXXXXINC collaborates with reliable and experienced suppliers. Key suppliers include:

· [CN Company] – The Parent Company providing high-quality shower rooms and smart mirrors.

· Foshan Co., Ltd. – Supplier of advanced bathroom technology components and smart home integration products.

· Foshan Co., Ltd.[1] – Supplier of innovative bathroom accessories and energy-efficient solutions.

In addition to its main business operation, XXXXXINC will also provide the following supplementary services to support its business operations and enhance customer experience:

· After-Sales Maintenance Services: The Company will also handle product returns, repairs, and repackaging, reducing reliance on third-party providers and minimizing product loss.

· Local E-Commerce and Engineering Services: XXXXXINC will build a local e-commerce team to strengthen its presence on U.S. platforms and provide customized support to local retail stores, decoration companies, and other small business clients.

· Installation and Distribution Services: To provide all-service customer experience, the Company will offer product installation and distribution services upon customer request, supporting seamless delivery and setup for its clients.
