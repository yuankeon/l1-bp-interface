I need your help in writing "SWOT Analysis" section.

Sample:
Strengths        Weaknesses
•        The Parent Company’s direct investment in the United States establishes an integrated business chain, from R&D to sales, enhancing cost efficiency and enabling seamless communication.
•        Extensive manufacturing experience provides robust technical expertise and reliable after-sales support for customers.
•        Preliminary agreements with Chinese companies requiring U.S.-based warehousing and after-sales services set a strong foundation for growth by ensuring an initial customer base.
•        Proximity to U.S. end consumers allows for a better understanding of local market needs, enabling the Chinese team to develop targeted products that can quickly capture market share.        •        Limited knowledge of U.S. laws and regulations may result in legal challenges that need to be navigated.
•        English language proficiency requires improvement to ensure smooth communication and mitigate potential business hurdles.
Opportunities        Threats
•        Local building materials suppliers like Home Depot and Lowe’s have slower product updates, particularly in design and style. The Company’s modern, trend-conscious products appeal to younger consumers, offering a competitive advantage.
•        The growing e-commerce market in the United States provides a fertile environment for establishing and expanding online sales channels.
•        Few Chinese manufacturers have directly invested in the U.S. market due to barriers like language, culture, and distance. This presents a relatively untapped “blue ocean” market with significant potential for growth.        •        The tense political relationship between China and the United States introduces uncertainties and external risks that may impact investment and operations.
