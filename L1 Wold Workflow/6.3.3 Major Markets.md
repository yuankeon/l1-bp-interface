Sample:
The trend toward DIY projects is gaining popularity as consumers opt to purchase floor coverings and complete projects themselves. With an expected increase in disposable income, the DIY sector is projected to grow. On the other hand, professionals in the industry are facing challenges due to high borrowing costs and consumer sensitivity to premium services.
Do-It-Yourself Becomes More Popular
The category of do-it-yourself projects, which involves consumers purchasing floor coverings like tiles and rugs and completing the work independently, has seen a surge in popularity. The rise in per capita disposable income in 2024 is expected to fuel the expansion of the DIY sector. The affordability of DIY work has made it the preferred method for home improvement, especially with the financial constraints faced by many consumers due to rising prices.
Professionals are Sensitive to High Borrowing Costs
Professionals in the Repair and Remodeling Industry, including contractors, landscapers, property managers, and maintenance professionals, are facing challenges due to high borrowing costs. The weakening economic conditions have resulted in reduced spending on do-it-for-me services. Consumers are becoming more cautious in spending on premium services due to inflationary pressure. The increased interest rates have made borrowing more expensive for contractors, affecting their willingness to undertake repair and remodeling projects.
The U.S. Bathroom Products Market
The United States Bathroom Products Market size is estimated at $358.08 million in 2024, and is expected to reach $421.20 million by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 3.30% during the forecast period (2024â€“2029). 
One of the factors that increased the demand for bathroom products is the increasing consumer spending on home improvement and remodeling projects in the United States. This trend has increased due to the rising home prices and low mortgage rates. Furthermore, the major manufacturers provide product warranties and guarantees to extend the product's lifespan, which leads to market growth.
Rising Consumer Spending on Home Improvement
A key driver of market growth is the increasing consumer spending on home improvement and remodeling projects in the United States. Factors such as rising home prices and historically low mortgage rates have encouraged homeowners to invest in upgrades and renovations. Moreover, major manufacturers offering product warranties and guarantees have extended the lifespan of bathroom products, further driving market growth.
The Growth of Smart Bathrooms
The demand for smart bathrooms is a pivotal trend shaping the market. Features such as voice, motion, and function recognition allow users to control lights, security, and temperature via smartphones, enhancing convenience and functionality. Digital accessories like smart shower panels with LCDs, touchless technology, and infrared taps not only improve user experience but also conserve water and energy. Integration with devices like Alexa and Google Home has further popularized smart bathrooms, making them a sought-after choice for consumers in the United States.
