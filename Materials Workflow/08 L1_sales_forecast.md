I'm drafting the L1 Business Plan. The attachment contains the original information submitted by the applicant. Please refer to relevant companies in the industry and formulate a reasonable 3 - year sales assumptions.
The forecast should be closely related to the operation plan provided by the applicant.
This content should convey full confidence so that after reading it, the reviewing officers will feel that it is only natural for the applicant to successfully carry out this business.

Requirements:
1. The NET profit/Sales ratio for each year should be between 1% and 10%, and this ratio should increase year by year.
2. The direct cost of sales is the sum of the product cost and other costs. Other costs are the sum of the costs of packaging and auxiliary materials as well as logistics and warehousing. Please help me evaluate an appropriate amount for the other costs.
3. For the sales volume that exceeds 10, the value should end with 0.
4. Output two tables. In the first table, the rows are the sales content, and the columns are the sales volumes for each year from Year 1 to Year 3. In the second table, the rows are the sales content, and the columns are the total sales amounts for each year from Year 1 to Year 3.
5. Then, output a sales forecast description. Based on the market analysis, figure out how many potential users there are and roughly how much the users are expected to budget for this matter each year.
6. Finally, list the references and URLs. Print out the link directly and don't embed it as a hyperlink within the text.
