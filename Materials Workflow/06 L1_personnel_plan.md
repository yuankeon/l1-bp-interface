I'm drafting the L1 Business Plan. The attachment contains the original information submitted by the applicant. Please refer to relevant companies in the industry and formulate a reasonable 3 - year Personal Plan.

Requirements:

0. Salary standards can refer to Indeed Salaries, Glassdoor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Salary.com, etc., and should take the company's location into account.
1. Please strictly adhere to the recruitment plan in the materials, and do not fabricate job positions or the number of recruits. Try not to change the job titles in the original materials as much as possible.
3. In the first year, there are 4~6 people including myself, 6~8 people in the second year, and around 12 people by the third year.
3. Output a table with job titles in rows and the number of employees in each job position from Year 1 to Year 3 in columns.
4. Output a table where the rows are the job titles and the columns are the corresponding annual salaries for each position. Since it is a startup company, the annual salaries can be set at a medium to lower level within the industry.
5. Only one salary amount needs to appear in the salary column, and there is no need to show a range.
7. The salary of the founder can be relatively lower than the market standard in order to minimize the company's operating costs as much as possible.
8. In the first year, it is necessary to have the Sales position as soon as possible. Alternatively, the Sales and Marketing positions can be combined into one.
9. The total annual personnel costs in the first year should preferably not exceed 65% of the investment amount.
10. Finally, based on the 3-year personnel plan and salary standards, generate two more tables. One table is the 3-year salary standards (the rows are the job titles, and the columns are the annual salary standards. For each position, starting from the year when there is an employee in that position, the salary will increase by 5% every year thereafter. If the number of employees in a particular year is 0, the corresponding value in that cell should be 0). The other table is the 5-year detailed salary breakdown (the rows are the job titles, and the columns are the total salaries that need to be paid for each position every year).
11. There should be a "Total" in the last row of each form.
12. Only in Year 1, it is necessary to consider the month when employees join the company, and then list the month when the employees join the company , for example: month 1 , month 4, month 7. In the first year, the actual take - home pay also needs to be calculated according to the month of employment.
13. At Year 3, The number of Job Titles should be less than 10.
