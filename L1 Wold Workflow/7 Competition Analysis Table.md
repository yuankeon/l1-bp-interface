7.1        Competitive Advantages
7.1.1         Original Design
All products offered by the U.S. Subsidiary will be manufactured by Hangzhou FlowerKnows Electronic Commerce Co., Ltd. The Parent Company will, among other aspects necessary for product success, be responsible for creating makeup products that come in original and attractive packaging. Consumers tend to judge books by their covers. When they see that a brand has put effort into creating a visually pleasing package, they will assume that this is reflective of the brand’s effort to create a high-quality product. Brand packaging design  has a huge impact on brand identity and vice versa. It helps spread awareness of the brand and promises to deliver on the unique value proposition. When designing the Company’s products, the Parent Company will keep in mind its target audience and will make sure that it speaks to the personality of America Flower Knows Biotechnology Co., Ltd.’s brand. The U.S. Subsidiary product package design will leave a lasting impression on its customers.
7.1.2         New Releases
A new wave of “fast beauty” brands are shortening their innovation cycles and getting products to market quicker than ever before.  The massive hike in consumption in recent years has ushered in an era of “fast beauty” that requires brands to stay on top of the latest trends by churning out new products at breakneck speed for instant gratification. The most coveted beauty products, such as matte lipsticks, are ones driven by ultra-popular trends and usually hit the shelves immediately after a big cultural moment. As the marketplace grows increasingly competitive, waiting for months to develop products is a thing of the past. The see-now-want-now consumerist mood requires brands to stay on top of the latest innovations and place products in the hands of consumers at lightning speed.  America Flower Knows Biotechnology Co., Ltd. will stay on top of this industry trend by having the capacity to release a new line of products two or three times a year. The entire series of original products will be available to target customers who will value the Company’s commitment to providing them with new products regularly.
7.1.3         Stable Supply Chain
With all products offered by the U.S. Subsidiary being shipped to America Flower Knows Biotechnology Co., Ltd. from its Parent Company in China, it is essential for the Company to establish a stable supply chain that will operate without many intermediaries and unnecessary delays. America Flower Knows Biotechnology Co., Ltd. will be able to rely on fast and effective product delivery as it will be able to rely on Hangzhou FlowerKnows Electronic Commerce Co., Ltd. business network and its many cooperate warehouses in different countries around the world, all working towards providing the Company with the most efficient and easiest product transportation to California. In this way, supply chain time waste will be reduced because of improved speed and collaboration across and between companies to control and monitor the execution environment. When inventory, capacity, logistics, and suppliers are managed effectively through connected supply chain planning, total costs are lowered because there is less excess and better collaboration. 
7.1.4         The Parent Company’s Support
Having the backing of an easily recognizable brand that has amassed a large online base of followers and support will be a key competitive advantage for the Company. Not only will the Parent Company handle the entire manufacturing process of America Flower Knows Biotechnology Co., Ltd.’s products, Hangzhou FlowerKnows Electronic Commerce Co., Ltd. will also be responsible for product quality testing, allowing the U.S. Subsidiary to focus its effort on penetrating the U.S. market and creating a large pool of satisfied and repeat customers. The Parent Company’s massive online presence will also spill into the U.S. Subsidiary’s brand recognition in the U.S. Hangzhou FlowerKnows Electronic Commerce Co., Ltd. currently has over 2.3 million followers on its social platforms that represent the Parent Company outside of China. For the last two years, the Parent Company has been making significant and stable sales in the international market, with the repurchase rate for 2023 exceeding 13%. On top of that, Hangzhou FlowerKnows Electronic Commerce Co., Ltd. will also provide ongoing financial and consulting support to America Flower Knows Biotechnology Co., Ltd.
