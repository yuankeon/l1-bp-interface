6.2.1        Makeup and Beauty Market Trends
The global cosmetics market has seen tremendous growth in recent years, with the industry valued at $380.2 billion in 2019 and expected to reach $463.5 billion by 2027. The United States is currently the largest beauty market,  generating a revenue of $89.4 billion in 2020, while U.S. women use makeup daily at a rate of 63.9%. On average, consumers spent approximately $103 on makeup products per person in 2022. Certain categories such as lipstick ($13.1 billion) and eye makeup ($21.4 billion) are growing steadily. Additionally, 45% of U.S women said their primary reason for using makeup was to enhance their natural appearance while 70% used skincare products regularly between 18-49 years old age group spending an annual average amount of $164. Furthermore, 35% of cosmetic sales were made through online channels worldwide which increased from 28%-41% in 2017 and 2018 respectively.
The global makeup market size was valued at $39.58 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow from $41.49 billion in 2023 to $58.15 billion by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 4.9% during the forecast period.  Grooming, looking good, and feeling good trend is rising worldwide, with women at the center of The Cosmetics Industry. The emerging Glamour Industry is boosting demand for makeup products that can alter their appearance among the young generation. Social media strongly influences this generation, with attractive product promotions showcasing newer market trends that focus on offering products for men's skincare needs to cater to its increasing demand.
The market is segmented into powder, gel, and lotion based on product. The powder segment is estimated to grow significantly in the coming years. Various cosmetics, such as face powder and powder foundation, are available in powder form, whether loose or pressed. Face powder is used as a base to apply bronzer, contour, or blush. Certain powders also help to reduce the look of pores and fine lines. Moreover, powdered contents are suitable for oily skin as they help absorb oily residue. Such factors contribute to the growth of the powder segment. The rising popularity of powder foundations among young users who demand light coverage drives the market segmental growth. It also helps control excess oil around the nose and forehead area, preventing the need for frequent reapplication and further increasing its demand. Companies are focusing on developing powder-based products that protect the skin rather than just enhance appearance.
Based on the application area, the market is segmented into lips, eyes, face, and nails. The face segment is expected to dominate the market as most consumers apply creams and powders on the face compared to other body parts, increasing its market demand. Key players focus on launching new facial skin-easing products developed according to the needs of different skin types, supporting segmental growth.
Based on distribution channels, the online segment is anticipated to hold the fastest growing CAGR during the forecast period owing to the rapid boom of e-portals during 2020. The North American makeup market share is expected to grow considerably from 2023 to 2030. Prominent players in the region provide a massive opportunity for consumers to access different beauty brands and select products according to their choice. This fosters demand in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. 
U.S. Beauty Industry sales revenue grew by 14% between January and September 2023, compared to the same nine-month period in 2022, according to Circana.  In comparison, mass-market beauty sales experienced a year-over-year increase of 8%.
 
Within the prestige channels, makeup was the fastest-growing category based on sales revenue. Lip makeup grew, driven by products such as oils and balms, as well as lip gloss, which grew faster than lipstick. All segments within face makeup grew, while eye makeup sales experienced the softest growth. According to Checkout, spending per buyer on makeup increased by 10% in 2023, while purchase frequency rose by 4%. 
The Beauty Industry’s digital transformation  between 2020 and 2022 shows no signs of slowing down, as new consumer habits meet an increasingly diversified market. Brands need to understand how to adapt as more spending moves online—or they risk missing out on key sources of revenues and new customers.
 
In 2022, the U.S. cosmetics and beauty retail e-commerce sales were more than double those of 2019 ($18.60 billion versus $9.21 billion). By 2026, those e-commerce sales will account for nearly a third of the category’s total retail sales.
