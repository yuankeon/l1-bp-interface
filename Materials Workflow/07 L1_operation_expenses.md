I'm drafting the L1 Business Plan. The attachment contains the original information submitted by the applicant and 3 - year Personal Plan & Salary. Please refer to relevant companies in the industry and formulate a reasonable.

Please, based on this information, evaluate my 3-year Operation Expenses.  The plan for the first year should be consistent with the monthly implementation plan of the U.S. company in the first year. Overall, it should be basically consistent with the regional expansion plan.

The general expense items are as follows:

Payroll
Payroll Taxes: Generally, it is defaulted to be charged at 15% of the Payroll.
Marketing expenses, the reference can be found at https://www.commercialcafe.com/office-market-trends/us/wa/seattle/
Rent, which has been included in the information submitted by the userã€‚
Utilities, which are generally calculated based on the office area. The cost can be referred to this website: https://www.starterstory.com/how-much-does-utility-costs-(office-space)
Insurance, which is generally calculated based on the number of employees. You can refer to https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-insurance/small-business-insurance-cost/
Maintenance, if there is a need for production and processing, this expense item will be included.
Professional Fees, if these positions are not included in the recruited positions, this expense item needs to be included.

Requirements:
0. The Total Expenses in the first year should not exceed the investment amount. If the lease states the deposit amount, add the deposit to the rent in the first year, and then include a note below the table to explain this.
1. If you have better calculation standards and reference standards, you can follow yours. If not, use the ones I recommended.
2. When designing these cost items, it is necessary to save as much as possible while complying with certain standards. The applicant's investment amount should be taken into account, and it should ensure that the company can survive healthily.And the total cost in the first year should not be greater than the investment amount.
3. Output a table where the rows are the names of each expense item and the columns are the expenses from Year 1 to Year 3.
4. Below the table, output the description of each expense item and indicate the source of reference.
5. Each expense item has clear source data and reference notes, which enhances the credibility of the financial forecast. By citing market research data, industry standards, and expert advice, the cost estimation appears objective and reasonable, rather than being based on arbitrary assumptions.
6. Finally, list the references and URLs.  Print out the link directly and don't embed it as a hyperlink within the text.
