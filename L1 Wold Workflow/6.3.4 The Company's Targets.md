SMEs (Small Retailers)
In 2024, small businesses continue to be a significant force in the U.S. economy, with 33.3 million small businesses operating across various sectors.  These businesses are responsible for creating 64% of new jobs annually, contributing to the vitality of local economies. Small retailers, which make up a substantial portion of these businesses, play a critical role in job creation and community development. With 99.9% of U.S. businesses classified as small, and many employing fewer than 100 workers, small retailers are crucial in providing products and services that cater to local and niche markets. XXXXXINC recognizes the importance of these small enterprises and aims to be a key supplier for them, offering high-quality bathroom products that align with their customers’ needs.
Small businesses, particularly in the retail sector, also have a strong impact on employment. As of 2021, nearly 10 million retail workers were employed at establishments with fewer than 100 employees.  This indicates that small businesses not only support the local economy but also provide essential jobs to the community. For small retailers, having reliable suppliers who can offer a broad range of high-quality, in-demand products is crucial for maintaining competitiveness and meeting customer expectations. XXXXXINC will help small retailers stand out by providing stylish, functional, and affordable bathroom solutions tailored to various market segments, empowering these businesses to serve their communities better.
A growing number of small business owners report positive outlooks on their operations. In the second quarter of 2024, 61% of small business owners surveyed indicated that their businesses were in good health, and 24% reported that their business conditions were average.  This optimism reflects a stable environment for growth and expansion. By providing bathroom products that cater to the latest trends and customer demands, XXXXXINC will support small retailers in meeting the expectations of their clientele and growing their market share in the ever-evolving Home Improvement Industry.
Renovation Companies (Contractors)
The demand for professional services in the Renovation Industry, particularly for bathroom renovations, is substantial. In 2024, 83% of homeowners reported hiring professionals to assist with master bathroom renovations.  This indicates a significant reliance on contractors to deliver expert services in home remodeling projects. Renovation companies are crucial in helping homeowners realize their visions, ensuring that installations are carried out efficiently and to a high standard. XXXXXINC is committed to supporting renovation companies by supplying a wide array of top-quality bathroom products, from shower rooms to smart mirrors, that meet the needs of both contractors and homeowners. By offering durable, modern solutions, the Company empowers contractors to provide their clients with the best possible outcomes, enhancing their reputation and helping them grow their businesses.
General Public – End Consumers
The general public will also be a key target market for XXXXXINC as the demand for modern bathroom products continues to rise.  As more homeowners focus on upgrading their living spaces, particularly their bathrooms, there is a growing interest in high-quality, stylish bathroom products that improve both functionality and aesthetics. XXXXXINC will provide a range of products designed to meet the diverse needs of consumers, offering accessible and luxurious solutions that cater to various tastes and budgets.
