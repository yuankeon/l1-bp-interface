I am currently helping the client to write a L1 VISA Business Plan, and the above information was submitted by the client.
I need your help in writing "Ownership of the U.S. Company" section.

Requirements:
1. Only make associations and expansions based on the information already provided by the user, and do not fabricate facts that do not exist.
2. After you finish writing this part, closely match the style, tone, and formal language of the provided Sample.
3. Just output the plain text without formatting.
4. Do not need a section title.

Sample:

The ownership structure of XXXXXINC is as follows: [CN Company]holds a 51% stake, Ms. Aowns 30%, and Mr. Bholds the remaining 19%. This structure allows the Parent Company to maintain majority control while Ms. A, as CEO and part-owner, plays a vital role in the Subsidiary's operations. Her expertise in international trade and business development ensures a direct link between the strategic goals of the Parent Company and the operational success of the U.S. Subsidiary.
