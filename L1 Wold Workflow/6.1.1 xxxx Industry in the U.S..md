According to IBISWorld,  one of the world's leading publishers of business intelligence specializing in Industry and procurement research, the Online Perfume and Cosmetic Sales Industry comprises companies that sell perfume, makeup, and other cosmetic products online. This industry includes revenue generated online by companies that also operate brick-and-mortar stores.
 
The industry has expanded rapidly, largely due to shifting consumer purchasing patterns. As more consumers purchase items online, industry demand has increased at a CAGR of 1.7% to $12.3 billion through the end of 2023. The growing prevalence of broadband and mobile internet connections has underpinned changing consumer habits by facilitating the ease of online shopping and enabling consumers to quickly compare prices among retailers.

Online retailers have increasingly targeted underserved demographics, such as millennials and male shoppers. Millennials are comfortable shopping online and account for a rising share of the workforce, which is arming them with more disposable income to spend on industry goods. These consumers are very brand-sensitive and likely to trade up for high-value goods with a strong reputation. As social media has become a dominant marketing tool, it has enabled a growing number of users with large followings to join the industry. Online retailers are also targeting male consumers more, as this segment has historically been an untapped market within cosmetics industries. The Millennial and male consumer segments have grown strongly through the end of 2023 as cosmetic manufacturers have tailored products and marketing strategies specifically to them.
 
Industry growth is anticipated to continue through the end of 2028 as online beauty sales become more normalized among users. As leisure time remains constrained, the convenience of e-commerce will become increasingly appealing. Also, increased mobile internet connectivity will enable shoppers to make purchases on the go, strengthening the industry's performance. Revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.3% to $14.5 billion through the end of 2028.
