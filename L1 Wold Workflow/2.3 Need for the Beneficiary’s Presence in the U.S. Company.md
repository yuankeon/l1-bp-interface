I am currently helping the client to write a L1 VISA Business Plan, and the above information was submitted by the client.
I need your help in writing "Need for the Beneficiary’s Presence in the U.S. Company" section.

This section is critical for L1 visa approval as it must justify why the specific foreign employee must be transferred rather than hiring locally. It should argue that the beneficiary's expertise in management and operational strategies of the parent company is essential to ensuring the US subsidiary aligns with the parent company's vision. It should emphasize their knowledge of products, technologies, and quality standards, making them uniquely qualified to lead the US operation. This justification is vital for immigration officials to determine if the transfer meets L1 visa requirements.
