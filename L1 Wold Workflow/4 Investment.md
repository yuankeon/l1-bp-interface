I am currently helping the client to write a L1 VISA Business Plan, and the above information was submitted by the client.
I need your help in writing "Investment" section.

This section must detail the financial commitment to the US business. It should clearly state the total investment amount, breaking down contributions from each investor or source. This information demonstrates the financial viability of the business and shows substantial commitment to the US operation, which immigration officers will evaluate to determine if the business is adequately capitalized.

Requirements:
1. Only make associations and expansions based on the information already provided by the user, and do not fabricate facts that do not exist.
2. After you finish writing this part, closely match the style, tone, and formal language of the provided Sample.
3. Just output the plain text without formatting.
4. Do not need a section title.

Sample:
