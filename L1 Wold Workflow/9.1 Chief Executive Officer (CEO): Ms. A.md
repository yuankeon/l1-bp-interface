I am currently helping the client to write a L1 VISA Business Plan, and the above information was submitted by the client.

According to the information submitted by the user, there is information about Job Duties.
I need your help in writing the "Duties at the U.S. Company" section.

Task:
1. First, make a brief statement in the first paragraph to explain why the applicant is qualified for this position.
2. In the second paragraph, introduce the Duties at the U.S. Company.
3. The third paragraph is about the specific work content in the first year, which is presented in a table. The first column is "Tasks", the second column is "Personnel", and the third column is "Time". "Time" is expressed in percentage, and the sum should be equal to 100%.
4. After you finish writing this part, closely match the style, tone, and formal language of the provided Sample.


Guidances:
1. The job is 95% managerial in nature. The main tasks involve firmly implementing the board of directors' goals, handling day - to - day policy implementation, and establishing procedures. It is distinct from the executive track which focuses on setting the company - level goals for the organization.
2. When describing managerial work, words like "direct", "goal", and "execution" should be avoided as they are more related to the executive track. Instead, terms like "supervise" can be used. It is also necessary to look up the definitions of "Managerial" and "Executive", identify sensitive words, and refrain from using terms that are defined in the context of the executive track's regulations.
