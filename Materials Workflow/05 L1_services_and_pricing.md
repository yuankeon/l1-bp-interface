=== MARKET RESEARCH ===
{{L1_market_research}}

The attachment contains the market research results in the L1 Business Plan, as well as the original information submitted by the applicant. 
This original information includes the products, costs, and pricing envisioned by the applicant. 
Based on the results of the market analysis, conduct an in-depth research to evaluate how to set a more reasonable price and explain why. 
Please inform me of the final pricing result. You can simply select a reasonable value for the cost from the applicant's cost data. 
Please supplement the additional sales content therein into the products and services.
For the content in the revenue plan that cannot be placed in the "Products & Services" table, you can briefly explain it in a paragraph outside the table.

Guidanceï¼š
1. Do not change the product content provided by the applicant. Conduct the evaluation based on this content.
2. Provide a specific value for both the price and the cost, instead of using a range of values.
3. The pricing should be in line with the applicant's market positioning of their products.
4. The price should preferably end with 0 or 9.

At the end, output a table with five columns, which are respectively "Tier", "Price", "Features", "Cost", and "Cost Explanation".
