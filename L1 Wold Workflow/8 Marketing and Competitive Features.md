1    Marketing and Competitive Features

1.1    Website and Digital Marketing

The Company maintains a website at www.viplookhome.com. Search engine optimization (SEO) of the website will ensure that proper titles, meta descriptions, and keywords, both short- and long-tailed, are present on all pages of the website.

 

The Company will also devote a part of its budget to digital marketing to drive traffic to its website. Digital marketing will primarily focus on Google Ads keyword advertising campaigns and the display network—concentrating on the Los Angeles area. In addition to directly bringing visitors to the website, the digital marketing campaigns will build brand awareness by displaying the Company’s logo and ads on the Google display network, and, therefore, numerous websites with visitors interested in the Company’s products.

Proper search engine optimization and successful digital marketing campaigns will be among the key growth and development factors of the Company’s business. Online marketing and promotional efforts will help the Company rank higher in search engine result pages, which will lead to an increased number of visitors and, consequently, customers.

The Company will promote the website by conducting keyword marketing campaigns that focus on words and phrases such as smart mirror and shower rooms.

An ever-expanding social media presence is crucial in today’s business environment.

The Company will use social media to build lasting client relationships and boost awareness and demand for its products.

1.2.1   Facebook

Facebook's detailed targeting options, including demographics, interests, and behavior data, will allow the Company to deliver highly relevant ads to potential buyers. The Company will create engaging content, including product demonstrations, customer testimonials, and educational posts about the benefits of the products offered. Additionally, Facebook's marketplace feature will be utilized to offer products directly to consumers, enhancing the online shopping experience.

   The number of Facebook users in the United States is expected to keep growing steadily from 2024 to 2028, adding approximately 12.6 million users, which is a rise of 5.04%. By 2028, after nine years of consistent growth, the Facebook user base is projected to hit approximately 262.8 million, marking a new record.[3] This growing usage of Facebook in the U.S. presents an opportunity for XXXXXINC, as an increasing number of users means a larger pool of potential clients. This surge in engagement allows the Company to attract more visitors to its content, facilitating broader outreach and enabling targeted marketing strategies.

1.2.2   Instagram

On Instagram, XXXXXINC will showcase visually appealing product images and videos to attract attention from design-conscious customers and businesses. Instagram's visual format will allow the Company to display its products in real-world settings, highlighting their functionality and aesthetic appeal.

Additionally, Instagram Stories and Shopping features will be used to engage customers, offering promotions and product updates. By using strategic hashtags and geotags, XXXXXINC will enhance discoverability, ensuring that its content reaches the right audience in key regions. Regular posting and engagement will help build brand awareness and encourage community interactions.

On Instagram, as of 2024, the United States has 169.65 million active Instagram users, with the global user base projected to grow by 3.7%, reaching 1.4 billion users, according to Statista.[4] Instagram remains one of the leading social media platforms in the U.S., making it a crucial tool for businesses targeting    American consumers. Industry analysts predict that by 2025, the number of U.S. Instagram users will decrease slightly to 143.3 million, but will increase again to 148.3 million by 2026. Understanding these trends and user statistics will allow companies to tailor their digital marketing strategies more effectively, ensuring they reach the right audience and stay ahead in the competitive social media landscape.
